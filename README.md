# extinctionSEA
Code for revisiting the biogeography of SoutEast Asia while accounting for extinction.
In this repository I show the code used to call the main function of R package lemad to reconstruct the distribution of ancestors. In this code, several models will be fitted to data with different fixed rates of species extinction. 
I also include a code for plotting the output from lemad. Notice that lemad package now includes a function that does that.

The data used for the analysis was kindly provided by the authors of the revisited papers. I therefore have no the rights to make them available to the public.
